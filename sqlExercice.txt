For the aligns 4, 5 and 6 for the values that you do not mention I assumed default values.

1. Write a query that returns all bookings above 205 €
SELECT *
FROM booking
WHERE amount > 205

2. Write a query that returns the sum of all bookings above 205 €
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM booking
WHERE amount > 205

3. Write a query that gives the incremental total for each booking (booking 1: 130, booking 2: 330€, etc)
SELECT booking_id, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY booking_id)
FROM booking

4. Insert a second apartment in Porto (with 2 rooms), and a new booking on that apartment on day 2018-05-01
INSERT INTO apartment (city, number_of_rooms)
VALUES ('Porto', 2)

5. Write a query that shows the average revenue, and number of guests per apartment
INSERT INTO booking
( apt_id_ref, check_in)
VALUES
 ((SELECT apt_id FROM apartment WHERE number_of_rooms = 2), '2018-05-01')

6. Write a query that shows the average revenue, and number of guests per month
SELECT apt_id_ref, AVG(amount), SUM(number_of_guests)
FROM booking
GROUP BY apt_id_ref

7.
SELECT date_trunc('month', check_in), AVG(amount), SUM(number_of_guests)
FROM booking
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', check_in)

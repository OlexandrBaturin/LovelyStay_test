For the aligns 4, 5 and 6 for the values that you do not mention I assumed default values.

1.
SELECT *
FROM booking
WHERE amount > 205

2.
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM booking
WHERE amount > 205

3.
SELECT booking_id, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY booking_id)
FROM booking

4.
INSERT INTO apartment (city, number_of_rooms)
VALUES ('Porto', 2)

5.
INSERT INTO booking
( apt_id_ref, check_in)
VALUES
 ((SELECT apt_id FROM apartment WHERE number_of_rooms = 2), '2018-05-01')

6.
SELECT apt_id_ref, AVG(amount), SUM(number_of_guests)
FROM booking
GROUP BY apt_id_ref

7.
SELECT date_trunc('month', check_in), AVG(amount), SUM(number_of_guests)
FROM booking
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', check_in)
